# Movies-ETL
## Project Overview
The following project served as a form of applying the Extract-Transform-Load method in order to convert raw data that needs to be cleanes and structured before it can be analyzed. This goes as follows:

- Extract
Read the data, often from multiple sources

- Transform
Clean and structure the data in desired form

- Load
Write the data into a database for storage

For this specific exercise we extracted information from 3 different sources about different movies from 1990 to 2018, automating a pipeline that takes new data and does all the process instinctively.
